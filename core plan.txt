# Job & Walk-in Opportunity Platform (No AI)

## FULL ROBUST, STAGE-BASED PRODUCT & DEVELOPMENT PLAN

---

## 🚀 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This platform is a **rule-based, admin-controlled opportunity system** focused on **Jobs, Internships, and Walk-ins** for students and fresh graduates.

The product exists to solve a single critical issue:

> *Students miss real opportunities because job information is scattered across hundreds of groups, channels, and pages.*

This platform centralizes, filters, validates, and tracks opportunities in a **strict, stage-driven flow**. There are **no recruiters**, **no automation engines**, and **no intelligent assistants** inside the system.

Every feature is built using **clear rules, explicit conditions, and manual verification**.

---

## 🎯 PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY

* Accuracy over volume
* Structure over chaos
* Eligibility over spam
* Trust over virality
* Daily utility over browsing

This is **not a job board**.
This is a **daily opportunity control system**.

---

## 🧭 CORE LOCKED FLOW

Nothing happens randomly.
No step can be skipped.
Each stage unlocks the next.

**Landing Page → Authentication → Mandatory Profile Setup → Dashboard → Opportunity Discovery → Opportunity Details → User Action → Personal Tracking**

If a stage is incomplete, all downstream stages remain locked.
